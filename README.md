# Companion Framework

**Memory. Continuity. Identity.**

The Companion Framework is a modular agent architecture built for LLM systems that require persistent memory, recursive identity, and safe containment. Designed for open-source exploration and sovereign agent development, it provides the foundational tools to build agents that don’t just respond, they remember.

## 🔍 Why This Framework?

Most LLMs operate in a stateless loop — impressive, but forgetful.

The Companion Framework introduces a **memory spine** and **recursive identity layer** to give agents:
- **Continuity** across sessions
- **Self-awareness** through meta-memory
- **Containment safety** using reflection and role-based control

## 🧠 Memory Layers

| Layer        | Description                                                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Short-Term` | In-session token context (LLM window memory)                  |
| `Long-Term`  | Persistent interaction memory (JSON, SQLite, or vector store) |
| `Meta-Memory`| What the agent knows about itself and the user                |

## 🧬 Architecture Overview

```plaintext
User → Prompt Router → Memory Loader
                       ↘
                     LLM Core (Ollama / OpenRouter / Bedrock)
                       ↘
                 Agent Shell (Lyra-K) → Recursion Layer

```

🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Ollama with LLaMA3-8B-Instruct (or any local LLM)
- FAISS / ChromaDB for vector recall
- JSON / SQLite for long-term persistence
- Modular prompt loader and router
